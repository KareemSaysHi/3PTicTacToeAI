How to setup everything with vscode:

Install the extention for c/c++: make sure you set the compiler to gcc-11,
and make sure to add in all the include paths. You should be squiggle free if you set this up right.

Then install the vscode extention for cmake.

Use command-shift-P to open the command pallette, and from those options select cmake build.

Then use cmake run without debugging to run the project.
